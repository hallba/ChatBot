title: How to use advanced temporal operators
description: >-
  This tutorial will give you a quick walkthrough of the advanced temporal operators available
  in the Bio-Model Analyzer. 
  It will take around 10 minutes, and by the end of this you should know how to successfully
  use UNTIL, WEAKUNTIL and RELEASE.

        This is the final tutorial on how to use operators within the BMA. Here, we will be
        concentrating on the advanced operators UNTIL, WEAKUNTIL and RELEASE.

        As an example, we will be using the phosphorylation model that you may have used in
        other tutorials. Click the link below to upload the model into your browser.

        Let's start off by experimenting with the UNTIL operator. The UNTIL operator works with
        two operands, where the first holds its true value up until the point the second becomes
        true.

        Here we will be creating two states: state A which refers to X = 0 and state B which refers
        to Y = 1. See the image below to check if you have created the states correctly.

        Now, open the LTL editor and create a new temporal property using the lower plus sign.
        Once opened, plug in A UNTIL B and run the query. As shown below, this should result in some
        true and some false results.

        By examining the results we can see that the first three steps hold the value for X, and then 
        in subsequent steps B is also true.
        NOTE: When using UPTO, until the second state is not satisfied, both states cannot be true within 
        the same step. Also, after B becomes true the value of A can fluctuate.

        Now moving onto the WEAKUNTIL operator. This is similar to UNTIL explained above, however does 
        not require the second operand to ever become true, and therefore the first one remains true, 
        but this case is not often seen in simulations.

    - text: >- 
        If we ran the same simulation A WEAKUNTIL B, you can see the results are similar to UNTIL as 
        no other traces have been found (of B never becoming true).
        TASK: To satisfy this query what would the state values be over the ten steps if B never 
        became true?

    - text: >- 
        To satisfy A WEAKUNTIL B, A would stay at a constant value of 0, and B would also be 0 as 
        it ranges from 0 to 1 and no other value can be assigned.

        Moving onto the RELEASE operator,
